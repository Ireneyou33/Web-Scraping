Virtual Volunteer Reader, Virtual Opportunity,"Become a virtual reading star by joining the PRC Read To Me campaign!


Record a video of yourself reading your favorite children’s story (suitable for children 1 to 6 years of age) and become the star you are meant to be (feel free to include other family members and pets).  We hope to have as many as 40+ videos that will play online and social media sharing the joy of reading during the pandemic and beyond.  Videos should be between two and fifteen minutes in length.  Animated reading (changes in voice and gestures etc…) is great but not required.  We are looking for volunteers to read in multiple languages (ex. English, French, Arabic, Spanish, etc…).  Where possible, we will select a few video stories and alter the video to include the words of the story for children that are hearing impaired. 


Volunteers are encouraged to identify themselves at the beginning of the video. (ex. “Hello, my name is Paula and I work with….  I am volunteering with the Parent Resource Centre by reading one of my favorite stories to you.  The story I am going to read today is…”).  At the end, volunteers are encouraged to close the story session with something like the following:  “I hope you enjoyed my book today”, “thank you for watching”, “I was happy to share with you today”.


We will provide you with a sample story session that you can watch to get you started via our YouTube channel.  Once your video is complete, you will be invited to upload it (preferably in MP4 format) to a private drop box folder. 


Please note, that we will require all volunteers to sign and return an electronic waiver that allows us to promote and play your video online and through social media. 


All videos will be reviewed prior to airing.


Please contact Paula Coons at PCoons@parentresource.ca if you are interested in participating or have other questions. She will then send you the links you require to get started.


Thank you for being part of our effort to encourage storytelling, family time, and most of all reading.

Ambassador for Mary's Meals," virtual
","Mary’s Meals is currently providing a daily school meal to over 1.5 million children in 18 developing countries around the world. We are working on changing the lives and future of chronically hungry children and their communities. But we can’t do it without your help. The onset of COVID-19 has made it difficult to reach all of the communities we normally support, as places of education have closed around the world. We have made great strides in reaching those communities in any way we can, but are far from done.


We are currently in need of volunteers to share our online campaigns and contribute in any way they are able to including, but not limited to: spreading the word at your work place, distributing brochures, raising awareness through social media, and taking part in virtual events to brainstorm other ideas.  Other examples include: posting to one's social media sites, emailing friends and family and sharing the organization with a club that the volunteer is already involved in.


Being an ambassador with Mary's Meals simply means spreading awareness in any way you can within your community and can be done virtually. Mary's Meals volunteers will hopefully be able to take part in virtual meetings with the Volunteer Team Lead in Ottawa in the effort to support each other and make a difference to the children who need it.


As COVID-19 and the different restrictions unfold, volunteers will be updated and will be involved in developing different strategies to accomplish our goals of spreading awareness and raising funds.


We're looking forward to hearing from you!
