We are in URGENT NEED of foster parents!
 
Abbey Cats is a non-profit rescue that specializes in caring for pregnant queens, moms & kittens, and orphaned kittens.
We are looking for foster parents who have the space, time, and love to be able to care for these special ones. 

Cats are excellent mothers, and although it can seem intimidating - caring for a mother cat and kittens is actually less intensive than it sounds! 

Knowledge and experience is an asset, but if you have patience, love, and are willing to learn - you could still be a great fit! 
If you are interested, please fill out a foster parent application. ---> abbeycats.org

Second only to finding a permanent home for each and every cat in the program, fostering is one of the most important aspects of Abbey Cat Adoptions.
● Foster parents welcome kittens, pregnant queens, mothers and kittens, or occasionally adult cats into their homes for their duration of time in rescue. 
● Foster parents provide all of the love and care to these cats until the time of their adoption. 
● Duties of the foster parent include: 
- adherence to an appropriate feeding schedule
- introduction to the 'litter box' and maintenance
- socialization of kittens (and cats) 
- writing bios of kittens (cats): their personalities, and how they interact with other felines and people
- taking photos and uploading them to Google Drive
- communicating any questions or concerns to a member of the Abbey Cats Foster Support Team
- Administering oral medication (as needed) 

*** Once an interested adopter has been screened and approved through Abbey Cats, an adoption appointment is arranged that will take place in the foster parent's home. 

> Applicants for the 'foster parent(s)' volunteering position are interviewed, then given an extensive manual to read in order to familiarize themselves with Abbey Cat Adoptions' practices and procedures. 
>> A home visit will be conducted by a member of the Abbey Cats Team. 
>>> Each 'foster parent' is assigned an experienced Abbey Cats Foster Support Team member, who provides one-on-one support through the entire period of fostering.
>>>> Additional training will be provided as needed.
 
Fostering is done in-home, for the duration of the cat's time with Abbey Cat Adoptions, on a schedule that meets the cat's needs.

PLEASE NOTE: Foster parents interested in fostering young kittens (orphans, or recently weaned) need to be home every 4 hours for feedings.

Fundraiser:  We are looking for someone with experience and previous skills in fundraising to help us raise funds.  It's a bit tricky with us as we have no money that we can put into this.  We are a small non-profit that exists off of grants and donations so there are no funds allotted to fundraising itself.  On top of that, we are in a relatively poor area where people don't always have money to give.  This is why we are looking for someone with past experience to help us.  
If you think you have these kinds of skills to take on this kind of challenge please do email us.  We are fundraising for a seniors and disabled group so there is only so much they can do as well.

As a new organization run by a single founder, Conserve Democracy (CD) will benefit from some fundraising and recruitment of key helpers.  The Volunteer Recruitment and Fundraising Consultant (VRFC) will help develop and implement the plan to a) create an outreach event or strategy, b) recruit needed volunteers, and c) seek funding.  Ideally the VRFC will have some experience in this regard, but at least some good common sense and an ability to learn by trying will be needed.  The VRFC ideally also has some understanding of the nonprofit world, grant writing, be social media savvy, and have an interest in democratic issues...but that's quite a list.
 
This work will be done in coordination with the Founder, but mostly independently.  Scheduling can be flexible.  This is a low-stress situation as long as basic expectations are met.  And if the fit isn't there, so be it.
 
Your volunteer help will be appreciated and not taken for granted.  Thank you!

Combined with meetings under the previous name, the organization now has over 450 meetings under its belt since 2011. MHSN/DBE continues to host weekly support groups and socials.
Weekly Support Group (MHSN + DBE) Format
When: Every Monday night from 7 – 9:30 PM
Where: St. Joseph’s Health Centre, 30 The Queensway, Toronto, ON
We ask that facilitators get to the room at least 30 minutes early to set up the room.
The meeting is divided into two portions.
We begin our evening with the facilitators reading an Introduction to MHSN followed by the reading of our Comfort Agreement (which has been developed by our group members) and a Mindfulness Meditation or relaxation exercise. 
Once this is finished, there will be a couple of Peer engaging exercises also known as “ice breakers” (the ice breakers may change from week to week) This will be followed by a 10-15 minute break.
An example of an “ice breaker” is:
Everyone shares a “wellness tool” that makes them feel better. Each icebreaker is optional.
In the second portion of the meeting, we break off into small groups of 3-5 people (depending on number of attendees). We use this time to focus on individual concerns or questions pertaining to mental health. Members may use this time to offer a situation to the group for reflection and feedback, to ask specific questions, to vent and get something off your chest, or simply listen. Each small group will have a facilitator to ensure things run smoothly and that every member gets an equal opportunity to share.
The small groups typically end around 9:20 PM, at which point we reconvene in the larger group to do a feedback/check-out exercise, where everybody has a chance to share their thoughts on the evening as well as offer feedback on how to improve the group. At this point we also want to ensure that everyone is safe to go home, and if not we ask that they come speak to facilitation team.
Once the meeting concludes, the facilitators check-out with each other to offer support and guidance on anything that may have come up in the meeting and tidy up the room before leaving.

We are looking for volunteers to join our Public Policy and Advocacy department.
The Canadian Association for Equality is committed to achieving equality for all Canadians, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, family status, race, ethnicity, creed, age or disability. In particular, we are interested in gender equality, that is on achieving equality for all men, women, girls and boys. While we support all efforts at achieving gender equality, we will work for balance and fairness within this societal project by focusing our limited resources on those areas of gender which are understudied in contemporary culture. This has led us to a current focus on the status, health and well-being of boys and men, where attention, investment and support for educational and social programs stands at a level that is far from equal to the seriousness of the problem, while also being significantly underdeveloped compared to the resources in other important areas of social improvement. 

Major areas of concern: 
* Boys crises – Education, drop out, under-enrolment * Workplace Issues eg. Workplace safety * Men’s Health * Family law/Fathers rights * Men and Violence (domestic violent, warfare) * Crime and Punishment/Legal Biases against Men * Media, Social and Cultural Misandry * Academic Misandry We provide current evidence-based research and balanced information. 

We also provides opportunities to engage in furthering this cause by participating in discussions, events and family-friendly activities. We sincerely believe the goal of true equality and human rights is best served by conducting inclusive conversations based on facts and evidence, not by promoting ideology or special interest agendas. CAFE is looking for individuals to undertake research and policy writing in a variety of areas, including boys issues, fathers issues and men's health. Those with a research and policy writing background are especially encouraged to apply.

The Canadian Association for Equality is committed to achieving equality for all Canadians, regardless of sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, family status, race, ethnicity, creed, age or disability. In particular, we are interested in gender equality, that is on achieving equality for all men, women, girls and boys. While we support all efforts at achieving gender equality, we will work for balance and fairness within this societal project by focusing our limited resources on those areas of gender which are understudied in contemporary culture. This has led us to a current focus on the status, health and well-being of boys and men, where attention, investment and support for educational and social programs stands at a level that is far from equal to the seriousness of the problem, while also being significantly underdeveloped compared to the resources in other important areas of social improvement. 

Major areas of concern: 
* Boys crises – Education, drop out, under-enrolment * Workplace Issues eg. Workplace safety * Men’s Health * Family law/Fathers rights * Men and Violence (domestic violent, warfare) * Crime and Punishment/Legal Biases against Men * Media, Social and Cultural Misandry * Academic Misandry We provide current evidence-based research and balanced information. 

We also provides opportunities to engage in furthering this cause by participating in discussions, events and family-friendly activities.

Mentor for Black Youth,"Toronto, Ontario",Children and Youth,Find Your Path Canada,2020-06-15,https://www.volunteertoronto.ca/networking/apply_now.aspx?view=2&id=607976,"

Find Your Path is a student-run non-profit aimed at helping Black youth and first-generation students realize their academic potential. We are so excited to announce that this summer we will run our third Afrocentric Summer Mentorship Program- with a virtual twist! The program will run for four weeks, from August 1st to 29th, 2020 with live online sessions on Saturdays, August 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29, 2020 from 12:00 to 1:30 pm. The goal of this program is to increase the academic and personal resilience of Black youth in Toronto from grades 7 to 12 and to establish positive and long-lasting mentorship networks with successful Black role models. As a mentor, your role is to be a guide, advocate, teacher, and social supporter for your mentees.


Each week, we will focus on a different African principle (e.g. Umoja/unity or Imani/faith) and our discussion of each principle will be grounded in a particular discipline (e.g. art or epidemiology). Weekly Saturday sessions will include an interactive presentation by an influential Black Toronto leader followed by group discussions and activities. Mentors will also meet with their paired participant(s) during the week. These meetings will include facilitated discussion based on the weekly principle and discipline, as well as free-form conversation guided by mentor and student interest. The total time commitment is approximately 3 hours each week in August as well as 2 training sessions in July.  For more information, please visit us at www.fypcanada.com or email us at info@fypcanada.com.

Mom’s kitchen is a volunteer-run not-for-profit organization that provides Pay-What-You-Can (PWYC)  home-cooked meals across Toronto. We believe that food is way more than just a basic human right - a home-cooked meal evokes nostalgia, is a way to reconnect to one's culture and roots, and a way to connect with family.


We hire women from all over the world (Somalia/ Ethiopia/ Pakistan/ Bangladesh, Jamaica, etc.) who live in Toronto and cook recipes that have been in their families for generations. By having a PWYC model, we make these home-cooked meals accessible to everyone, as we truly believe that everyone deserves a place at the table. Those who can afford more are able to ‘pay it forward’, while those who are under tight financial situations are able to consume a home-cooked meal for free.
 
 
We are looking for volunteers that can help us deliver these meals to people's homes. Deliveries are on Wednesday from 4-6pm - you will be asked to deliver between 5-10 meals, and should not take more than 1-2 hours of your time.

Mentees are carefully selected to receive the student awards grant from YSM to help fund their post-secondary education. 


Your role is to build a trusting, empathetic, and mutual relationship with a mentee and provide discernment as your mentee navigate the complex and uncharted yet exciting world of university/college.

We are seeking mentors who will empower and allow the youth to come up with their own solutions and ideas as they work through things like personal challenges, peer concerns, stress, competing academic and/or life demands, financial issues, goal setting, and career discernment.


If you are a successful candidate to be a mentor, you will be matched with one mentee and you are expected to meet with your mentee at least twice a week for one year. 


We are currently seeking committed individuals who are at least 24 years old, come from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, are mature, positive, professional, and motivational. To provide the best match for our students, we are seeking mentors who have been down the post-secondary journey themselves and possess a post-secondary degree or diploma.
 
Thank you for your interest in becoming a mentor. As of this moment, we have enough mentors who identify as female. We are currently looking for mentors who identify as male to mentor male post-secondary mentees.

Online Career Mentoring for Experienced Newcomer Professionals in GTA,"Toronto, Ontario",Settlement and Newcomers,TRIEC (Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council),2020-06-05,https://www.volunteertoronto.ca/networking/apply_now.aspx?view=2&id=605614,"

 
 
Are you located in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and do you enjoy sharing your professional experience and engaging with people from diverse backgrounds? Do you have a desire to motivate and inspire others? Do you like building networks and helping people make connections?
 
Then YOU would make a great mentor!
 
We would love you to join our community of volunteer mentors at the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC).
 
TRIEC Mentoring Partnership is career-focused program that matches a job-ready newcomer and a volunteer mentor with a similar professional background. Mentors help their mentees understand how the local job market works and build vital professional networks in GTA. In return, mentors learn leadership and coaching skills, gain knowledge of international business practices, and are able to better communicate with a diverse range of colleagues and clients.
 
Mentorship plays a key part in immigrant professionals’ success, as starting out in a new country with a limited professional network, often results in underemployment (taking a job that they are overqualified or underpaid for). 77% of mentees find a job in their occupation or related field within 6 months of completing their partnership.
 
What we ask:

Commit to 18 hours over 3-months. Meetings can be virtual via phone, video call and etc. during the COVID-19 pandemic
Plan to: collaborate with your mentee to help them identify their goals and draft their action plan; share insights about your occupation, industry and Canadian workplace culture generally; identify and facilitate networking and skill building opportunities for your mentee and guide and motivate your mentee in their job search

 
What you get:
TRIEC mentors can access a range of professional development resources including:

Workshops – build cross-cultural competencies and develop your coaching skills using a solution-focused approach
Webinars – gain action-orientated tools and tips for supporting your mentee in their job search

 If you are a member of HRPA or CPA you can claim professional development credits

Networking events – provide the opportunity to meet new and experienced mentors, and exchange solutions and best practices

 
Mentoring with TRIEC helps you:

Enhance your leadership and coaching skills
Develop competency in cross-cultural communication
Keep up-to-date on the job market and industry trends
Give back to the community and your professional sector or field 

 
What you need:

You reside in the Greater Toronto Area 
At least two years of full-time professional experience in your field in Canada
A respect for cultural diversity and have a desire to deepen your understanding
A commitment to actively support your mentee in their job search
A willingness to listen to your mentee and provide advice and introductions relevant to their experience  
A set of references which you’ll be asked for before starting your partnership

 
What you don’t need:

A huge professional network (mentees benefit from your insight into your profession— it’s not all about making introductions, though they can help) 
Decades of work experience (you are there to be a facilitator and to contextualise the Canadian workplace, not to have all the answers)

Prospective mentors from all industries and occupations are encouraged to apply, however, we are currently experiencing an especially high demand for mentors in Marketing & Sales, Business Development, IT, Healthcare, and Engineering and Architecture.

Describe our economic value proposition to our customers (What needs/problems does the project address? What value does the project generate? What is the certification actually giving our clients? What are the features of the product/service? What are the advantages of the project’s offerings?) Why would someone buy the goods and services we are offering?


Describe the team profile necessary to launch this certification (describe the team composition including the core members, advisors, employees, etc. and their profile)

About Bootcamps for Change: #SweatierForTheBetter: Over 1200 Youth Impacted!
Since August 2017, “Bootcamps for Change” has facilitated and organized weekly in-shelter health & fitness programs for youth experiencing homelessness in Toronto: Horizons for Youth, Eva's Initiatives & Yonge Street Mission. We have also branched out to Thunder Bay, Ontario with John Howard Society. 
Our programs allow youth to improve their physical health, mental health, and resilience. After seeing first-hand the natural athletic ability of youth we were meeting, we started the “#SweatierForTheBetter” scholarship. This funds fitness certification for homeless youth, in addition to providing any career or mentorship resources they may need. The recipients are subsequently paid by us to facilitate fitness programs to their peers in shelters, in addition to being connected with local mentorship and job opportunities. All scholarship recipients we have certified in Toronto are currently in full-time positions at LA and Goodlife Fitness in Toronto, exiting the shelter system. 

Health and fitness is THE vehicle driving our ultimate goal; removing barriers for prosperous, healthy and employable youth development. We want to prevent youth in the system from becoming adults in the system.

Health and fitness is THE vehicle driving our ultimate goal; removing barriers for prosperous, healthy and employable youth development. We want to prevent youth in the system from becoming adults in the system. 
You will be responsible for one of the following research projects. All projects have a 1-month timeframe, with a 2 week scheduled check-in with the founder. If more support is required, we are more than willing to provide it. 


Research Project 1: Research on Homelessness for Impact Gaps Canvas Canada: This project can be done based on your own experience, online research, and interviews conducted with homeless frontline workers/advocates/organizations, etc.
I. Challenge Mapping: What's happening, what's the impact of the challenge, and what's holding the challenge in place?
II. Impact Gaps: What is missing that could close the gap between the challenge and the current solutions, where are opportunities for greater collective impact, and what are the key lessons learned?
III. Solutions Mapping: What models are already being tried, what's working, what's not, and what resources are currently available? 
This ‘Impact Gaps Canvas’ was designed by Skoll Centre Deputy Director, Daniela Papi-Thornton, as part of her research for the Clore Social Leadership Programme. This canvas is a tool to help you ask the questions you might want to consider in creating your entry for the Challenge. By asking questions related to the challenge landscape (questions about the problem and its impact as well as what might be holding the current status quo in place) and the solutions landscape (what is already being tried and what has or hasn’t worked) you can then identify gaps where the solutions are failing to meet the problems.
Research Project 2: Fitness influencer research: Canada
- To create awareness about the #SweatierForTheBetter programs, we will be working with fitness influencers. You’d assist us by researching fitness influencers in an assigned city (such as Ottawa, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, or Kingston) including their names, where they are located, their social media links, contact information, and a brief summary about what specific fitness certification(s) they hold, if any. 
Research Project 3: Partnership Research: Homelessness Agencies Canada

Research Project 4: Partnership Research: Fitness Professionals
- To recruit fitness professionals to implement our #SweatierForTheBetter programs and perform market research, we work with a range of fitness professionals (yoga instructors, personal trainers, group fitness instructors, boxing coaches, meditation teachers, etc). You’d assist us by researching fitness professionals in an assigned city (such as Ottawa, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Kingston or Toronto), organized by what type of fitness professional they are, their names, social media links, contact information, and a brief summary about what specific fitness certification(s) they hold.
Research Project 5: Fitness Brands (equipment)

Research Project 6: Run Clubs in Canada
- To fundraise and create awareness for our programs, we will be engaging run clubs in Canada. You’d assist us by finding the names of run clubs, including their names, where they are located, their social media links, contact information for their “leader”, and a brief summary about the “vibe” or demographic of the run club - younger, older, healthy or do they grab a beer or donut after their run? 
Research Project 7: Canadian Fitness Brands (clothing) 
- To fundraise and get clothing donated for our programs, we will be working with Canadian fitness brands. A lot of these can be found on Instagram. You’d assist us by finding the names of fitness clothing companies in Canada, including their names, where they are based/founded, their social media links, contact information for their founder and marketing manager(s), and a brief summary about what type of clothing they create.
Research Project 8: Fitness Brands (rehabilitation supplies/equipment) 
- To fundraise and get equipment donated for our programs, we will be working with Canadian rehab supplies (i.e. https://www.performancehealth.ca/sports-medicine/rehab-equipment-supplies/rehab-supplies).

Research Project 9: Research into how we could make an environmentally friendly, branded resistance band
- As we are exploring alternative revenue streams, we are curious about the costs associated with and the process of how we could create and manufacture Bootcamps for Change branded resistance band.
Research Project 10: Social Entrepreneur Research: Canada
- As we would love to engage other social entrepreneurs to learn about their experiences, learnings and lessons on the way, we’d like to connect with them and potentially onboard them as consultants on our programs down the line. You’d research names of Social Entrepreneurs in Canada (probably best to use LinkedIn for this one), including their names, where they are based, their social media links (including LinkedIn/Instagram), contact information, and a brief summary about what type of social enterprise they founded in the following focus areas:


Youth


Homelessness


Poverty 


Health


Recreation


Research Project 11: Social Enterprise Support Research: Canada
- As we would love to learn more about social enterprise, and engage other players in the social entrepreneurship space, we’d like to research organizations in Canada that write about social enterprise/support social enterprise/social entrepreneurship, etc. You’d research names of these organizations in Canada (probably best to use LinkedIn for this one), including their names, where they are based, their social media links (including LinkedIn/Instagram), contact information (executive director or founder of the organization), and a brief summary about what they do specifically in this space.
Research Project 12: Partnership Research: Homelessness Advocates Canada
- As we would love to engage homelessness advocates to learn about their experiences, learnings and lessons on the way, in addition to engaging them to review our programs and share our mission, we’d like to connect with them.

Research Project 13: Partnership Research: Social Workers Canada
- As we would love to engage social workers to learn about their experiences, learnings and lessons on the way, in addition to engaging them to review our programs and share our mission, we’d like to connect with them. You’d research names of social workers in certain cities in Canada (probably best to use LinkedIn for this one), including their names, where they are based, their social media links (including LinkedIn/Instagram), contact information, and a brief summary about their educational background...i.e. MSW, BSW, addiction specialist, etc?. 
Research Project 14: Partnership Research: Physiotherapist Canada
- To recruit physiotherapists to implement our #SweatierForTheBetter programs and perform market research, you’d assist us by researching physiotherapists in an assigned city (such as Ottawa, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Kingston or Toronto), organized by what type of fitness professional they are, their names, social media links, contact information, and a brief summary about what specific fitness certification(s) they hold if applicable (a lot of physios have a background in strength and conditioning, for example), and what physiotherapy school they went to, in addition to the contact information for that physiotherapy school. 
Research Project 15: Partnership Research: Yoga Instructors Canada
- To recruit yoga instructors to implement our #SweatierForTheBetter programs and perform market research, you’d assist us by researching yoga teachers in an assigned city (such as Ottawa, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Kingston or Toronto), organized by their names, social media links, contact information, and a brief summary about what specific yoga + fitness certification(s) they hold.
Research Project 16: Partnership Research: Kinesiology/Physiotherapy/Social Work Schools in Canada
- To fundraise, recruit volunteers, and create awareness for our programs, we will be engaging with Kinesiology, Social Work and Physiotherapy schools in Canada. You’d assist us by finding the names of these schools in Canada, including their names of student engagement coordinator/student placement contact in these departments, what city they are located in, the schools’ social media links.
Research Project 17: Trauma-Focused Yoga Certification
- For market research, we’d like to look into how much the trauma-focused yoga certification(s) cost, what certifications exist, what the main curriculum themes are, and research on who holds this yoga certification in Canada and the USA.
Research Project 18: Partners within Fitness Certifications
We have had a researcher currently gather information about the mainstream fitness certifications, including their requirements, costs, renewal fees, CEC’s etc. 

We’d like to research the partners of these existing fitness certifications and what benefits they provide to their certification holders: 
I.e. NASM: Apparel & Footwear, Training Equipment, SMR & Recovery, Branded Training, Other: https://www.nasm.org/lp/discountpartners
https://www.canfitpro.com/membership/ 
Research Project 19: Board of Directors/Contacts at Major Fitness Certification 
Finding names and contact information for the major fitness certification providers in Canada + USA 
Research Project 20: Resistance band production and manufacturing
Researching process on how we could create a branded resistance band, including costs of production and manufacturing, market size, etc. There is a shortage of latex and rubber, so we’d be making a cloth one.
Research Project 21: Filling in contact info for Canadian Athletes 
We have a great list of Canadian athletes and Olympians. Now, we just need help finding the appropriate contact information for them. 
Research Project 22: Market Research for Fitness Certification + Resistance Band
""Doing good is not enough"" if quality and price are not also competitive. This research project would have you scheduling 15-minute calls with our network of fitness professionals and reaching out to new ones to ask them the following questions: 
Script: “We are considering creating a certification for professionals such as yourself to specifically work with at risk or homeless youth. We’re calling today to perform market research and ask you a few questions about your experience working in the fitness industry especially in the reality of COVID-19.”

Fitness professionals: 
1. If relevant, How much do you spend yearly on your CECs (continuing education credits)?
2. What fitness certifications do you currently hold?  
3. Do you consider the fitness industry to be more competitive or collaborative? 
4 How long have you been working in fitness? 
5. Is fitness your part-time or full-time job? 
6. How old are you? 
7. What is your gender? 
8. Do you work in a gym or work independently? 
9. Would a certification for you to learn to engage at-risk youth through movement be a product you would want to learn more about? 
10. At what price would you be willing to pay for something like this? 
11. How has COVID-19 changed how you might pivot - does this make youth certification more attractive as you’d like to diversify? 
12. What’s the most important factor you look at when choosing a fitness certification? 
13. How much would you pay for a resistance band? 
That’s it! Thank you.

Position Summary: As Bootcamps for Change’s #SweatierForTheBetter In-Shelter Youth Fitness Program Coordinator, this position will assist with our in-shelter fitness and youth scholarship program in various cities with overseeing and developing onboarding strategy, campaigns, conducting research, devising and presenting ideas to improve our shelter program.
 






Impact Orientation




Intended Impact Statement: User/Beneficiary: (Youth Experiencing Homelessness)




Our pilot will provide up to 10 interested youth with 4 weeks of sports rehab (physiotherapy) prior to our implementation of 8 (4 female/4 male) health and wellness sessions (yoga, weightlifting, physiotherapy, boxing, self-defense) in a youth homeless shelter. We will enlist 2 youths experiencing homelessness in our #SweatierForTheBetter scholarship/mentorship program to pay for them to become a certified personal trainer and group fitness instructor. Upon completion, we will hire them at $150/session for 4 sessions to teach fitness to their peers in-shelter, encouraged by fitness mentors. They will find meaningful (part-time+) work in the fitness industry in order to exit the shelter system, and live independently.




For whom? Youth (16-29*in-shelter fitness program, 18*scholarship-29) of all genders experiencing homelessness.




Geography: Toronto, ON (Blue Door, Eva's or Youth Without Shelter) or Vancouver, BC (Covenant House BC).




STRATEGIES AND/OR ACTIVITIES our organization delivers to achieve our intended impact(s)




Health and fitness is THE vehicle driving our ultimate goal; removing barriers for prosperous, healthy and employable youth development.




We cast a wide net in terms of providing beneficial fitness programming for homeless youth, but our core product/differentiator is the means to enroll in fitness certification education and hiring them directly to facilitate our wellness programs to their peers.




There is a dual benefit (directly providing employment to user #1, while providing free wellness programs to user #2 in a safe space).




These fitness/wellness services may be considered ""non-essential"" in society, but based on my personal and professional experience should be deemed necessary for optimal physical and mental health.




By empowering at-risk youth through work, our target market learns that with support and access to resources, the stereotypes surrounding this population are incorrect - encouraging them to get involved, which also enables our fundraising/volunteering model.




Project Details




Actual:




Products we sell: Tickets to our fitness fundraising parties: can take a variety of forms from group workouts to networking events between fitness professionals and the fitness industry consumers.




To whom: Fitness Enthusiasts: Typically young (22-35s) higher-income (50k+ independent income) typically but not exclusively females that frequent studio gyms or love staying active, very social, enjoys giving back to the community, and may work in fields like healthcare, technology, and finance. We also directly invite personal trainers, group fitness instructors, yoga instructors, boxing coaches, athletes, gym owners, etc. to these events to encourage awareness and therefore involvement in the organization.




How: Social media, word-of-mouth, effective stakeholder (gyms, fitness professionals, media, homelessness organization) engagement.








Intended:




Products we want to sell:




- An accredited, insurable fitness certification to effectively engage at-risk/homeless youth using movement. ""#SweatierForTheBetter: Engaging At-Risk Youth Through Movement"" curriculum would include themes like mental health, diversity training, child protection policy and procedures, movement modifications, empathy, appropriate language and behaviours.




- Branded resistance bands (hopefully produced in an environmentally-friendly way).




To whom: Fitness professionals, gyms, teachers, existing fitness certification providers, universities/colleges.




How: Social media, word-of-mouth, strategic partnerships.








Actual or intended OUTCOMES/IMPACTS of our Social Enterprise activities, including who our beneficiaries are.




Actual: Our current scholarship recipients in Toronto (3): have the foundation for sustainable livelihood: increased social inclusion, increased dignity and security, and improved cash flow.




One scholarship recipient cited our program as the reason he quit smoking heavily.

- The recipient has exited the shelter system (living independently)




- The recipient is able to gain meaningful (part-time+) employment




- The recipient remains actively involved with the Bootcamps for Change organization








Beneficiary 2: In-Shelter Fitness Program Participant:




- Youth has the ability to use tools learned in the workshop independently




- Confidence increased since beginning the program








Program Delivery: Fitness Professionals mentoring beneficiary 1, Teaching in-shelter to beneficiary 2, or learning through our #SweatierForTheBetter certification:




- Improved perception of the homeless population




- New understanding of challenges at-risk youth face and new-found ability to engage youth experiencing homelessness through empathetic movement




- Continued advocacy in the field








Economic, Health and Social Outcomes:




We want to look at this from every angle: economic, health and social.




The potential economic impact includes: increased economic output from employment and the cost savings from housing/shelters, medical costs associated with hospitalization and low physical activity levels, incarcerations costs, and treatments for alcohol/drug addiction.








How our Social Enterprise contributes to the organization’s mission and intended impact (or already does), and why our organization is well-positioned to lead this Social Enterprise.




We will employ a social franchise business model, involving distinct components for revenue generation and for carrying out the mission of the organization.








Our core innovation is to open up new channels for consumerism in the fitness industry to improve societal capital by helping fund the programs that help youth access education employment. Our customers have the opportunity to engage directly with our key beneficiary which is unique and invaluable.








The production of an accredited, insurable fitness certification for fitness professionals to teach at-risk youth would fit with the relationships we've built with fitness industry professionals and influencers to promote sales, while also improving the quality of in-shelter programs.








We position vulnerable populations should have equitable access to health services. Fitness can be intimidating. So, we cultivate a safe, inclusive space for youth to access these services in-shelter with their paid peers as teachers. There is typically a high barrier of entry to facilitate programs face-to-face with a vulnerable population, but due to our unique experience in addition to glowing reviews from shelters, youth, and fitness professionals, we have overcome this challenge.








Current status of Social Enterprise (e.g., ideation, feasibility testing, market researching, business planning/modeling, piloting, launching, operating, scaling)




Operating: Weekly In-Shelter Fitness Program (boot camp, yoga, weightlifting, mediation) at Horizons for Youth shelter in Toronto, ON and John Howard Society in Thunder Bay, ON: Over 250 fitness professionals mobilized.




#SweatierForTheBetter Scholarship: 3 youth completed after being scouted: two of which are hired full-time at LA and Goodlife Fitness, all three exited shelter system.




Scaling: In-Shelter Program: Covenant House Vancouver has reached out and would like to implement a pilot project as defined in Impact Orientation.




Business Planning/Modelling and Market Researching:




1. #SweatierForTheBetter Fitness Certification: Engaging At-Risk Youth Through Movement (Note: curriculum content is in ideation): Brainstorming partnerships (continuing education credits with existing fitness certification providers) and researching accreditation process and associated costs to develop this program.




Market Research:




- Gauging interest from fitness professional community




- Potential Pricing




2. In-Shelter Program: Implementing Sports Rehab (Physiotherapy) and Healthy food partner




3. Scholarship Program: Exploring methods to reach and open opportunity to at-risk youth that are not living in shelters - couch surfing, precarious housing, etc.






In-Shelter Youth Fitness Program and Scholarship Coordinator Projects:
 
Project 1. Bootcamps for Change #SweatierForTheBetter Employment Program
All of the youth we have currently onboarded our scholarship program we have ""scouted"" - meaning we have seen them participating in our in-shelter fitness program, witnessed their natural athletic + coaching ability, then ""pitched"" them after the session with the opportunity. We have been lucky, meaning all 3 have found full-time work in the fitness industry and are self-motivated. The success of our scholarship recipients says a lot about us.
However, as we scale and want to increase our reach, there are only about 2700 youth shelter beds in Canada, but up to 40,000 are homeless on any given night. Realistically, a very small subset of these youth would be a good fit for the scholarship, although they would all benefit from the in-shelter fitness program for their physical + mental health. Clearly, there is a lot of youth that could greatly benefit from this opportunity that we are missing: couch surfing, homeless for a short period of time, etc.
We are also exploring the idea to open this up to youth that just identifies as ""at-risk"": meaning their families may be low-income (we would have to define low-income parameters), or they are in an unsafe situation at home and are looking to flee. If we are exploring this idea, we have to make it fair by creating clear guidelines of what youth we could potentially accept, and which would be ineligible. Either way, we will need to create a clear definition of a ""great fit"" for this program, so we can also build an application form.

We need your help determining: 


A clear description of the youth we can accept into the scholarship program: (what constitutes ""at-risk?) *must be 18+


A clear description of a ""great fit"" for this program.


How can we make this process supportive and inclusive?


What questions should be on the application form for youth applicants? 


What questions should be on an application form for a ""Request for Support"" for shelters to fill out? (IMO: #SweatierForTheBetter Scholarship + in-shelter fitness program should be separate forms)


*If we are opening the opportunity to ""at-risk"", we should determine appropriate questions for guidance counselors, etc [TBD based on point of entry strategy]


Describing the channels to deliver the value to our beneficiaries: How will we reach out to the new beneficiaries? Through guidance counselors in low-income schools? Rec centers (i.e. YMCA)? How will we ""market"" our scholarship opportunity using tools such as social media, posters, email outreach, etc.? Through what channels do we communicate with the beneficiaries?


Explore our methods to build, and maintain relationships with the beneficiaries. Potentially using a platform like slack, but also scheduling check-ins and coming up with creative ideas for upcoming and previous scholarship recipients to support each other. 


 
Project 2. Youth Scholarship Recipient Engagement
We need your help exploring: 


What should be in a contract to be developed for youth (agreement on both sides, between us and the youth): We have not done this yet as we have had the chance and opportunity to really get to know the scholarship recipients beforehand and they are also ""vetted"" by the shelters in Toronto whom we have a great working relationship with. We cannot casually front thousands of dollars for youth we do not know. The success of our scholarship recipients says a lot about us.


What should be in a potential youth success roadmap while in the shelter system before they: i.e. quit smoking...then getting part time/full time work...then exiting the shelter system? 


Testimonials? How should we ask the youth for testimonials to be shared on the website and with our supporters...through a letter? How can we use these testimonials for marketing purposes?


Devising a calendar for the scholarship pilot 


Determining a Check-ins schedule and calendar 


 
Project 3. In-Shelter Fitness & Sports Rehab Program 
We need help with improving our fitness program in-shelters. We are starting to also offer sports rehab programming to youth living in shelters. We recognize that injuries disproportionally impact youth experiencing homelessness. Injuries are not only a barrier to exercise but also to living life to the fullest. Injuries impacts one’s mental health and also the ability to sleep well. 


We’d need help to create a sheet that the physiotherapist would fill out to help our in-shelter fitness instructors understand the injuries that the youth is currently facing. This should have a section indicating “movements to avoid” and “movements to perform” for the youth. This might involve scheduling a 15 minute phone call or chatting with physiotherapists in our network. Keep in mind you wouldn’t have to actually create these sheets, just determine the content that we would share with our incredible graphic designers.




We’d need help to create a sheet that the personal trainer or group fitness instructor teaching the in-shelter classes would fill out to help the youth perform the movements on their own. Keep in mind you wouldn’t have to actually create these sheets, just determine the content that we would share with our incredible graphic designers.


We need help improving our post-workshop feedback survey for youth. This is what we currently have:





Social worker research: We currently have a “Training document for Instructors” that highlights some surface-level basics on how to engage homeless youth through fitness that we share with instructors before they volunteer in-shelter. We need your help in improving this. We touch on things like mental health and cultural sensitivities, in addition to how to create a safe space. However, we should expand upon this existing knowledge. I think indigenous safety should also be included, some information based on addictions (and signs of an overdose), the scope of practice, injuries common in those experiencing homelessness and reminding fitness professionals to provide modifications, and examples of empathetic attitudes and language to use, and language to avoid. This may involve reaching out to professionals in these sectors, in addition to reaching out to social workers in our network to gather information. 




When fitness professionals come on our website, there should be a fitness instructor application for them to apply to volunteer or work at our shelter fitness programs. What questions should be on Fitness Instructor Applications? I.e. Why do you want to do this? What fitness certifications do you hold? Do you have any convictions? How did you hear about us? Etc. This may include chatting with social workers in our network. 


There should be a mentorship application as well. This one should include questioning if they have a vulnerable sector check, do they have any connections with local gyms, do you have any experience working with youth or vulnerable populations? 



Project 4. Request for support documents


When shelter workers come on our website, there should be an application for them to apply for support through our in-shelter fitness program. In order to create the best program for them and start streamlining our processes, what questions should be in this request for support? This should be framed like an initial needs assessment for the shelter.


When guidance counselors or youth come on our website, there should be an application form for them to apply for support through our #SweatierForTheBetter scholarship. What questions should be on this application?




Project 5. First steps to securing food at every workshop 


We need help securing food at every in-shelter workshop. You’d research and list major food charity/nonprofits in major cities including Ottawa, Calgary, Vancouver, Toronto, and Kingston, in addition to finding contact information for their staff. You could also help us by drafting an initial reach out email/partnership pitch to these organizations. 




Project 6. Engagement with fitness professionals leading up to opportunity in-shelter


There is ideally a 4 week lead up time to engage an instructor pre-workshop. We need your help building a calendar with the scheduled weekly check-ins with defined goals for each week. 

We need your help building different assets (social media posts, newsletter clippings that the instructor can send out or the gym they are working at can send out, and email outlines for their networks)for the following that the instructor can pick from, based on their passions: 
I.e. 


Donations for food


Donations for athletic clothing and running shoes


Donations for workout equipment


All 3: Donations for food + athletic clothing and running shoes, + workout equipment


Monetary donations for #SweatierForTheBetter Scholarship recipients: this can be done through our CrowdChange 



We need your help: 


Drafting thank you email for trainers post-workshop, including asking them to write a testimonial and like us on Facebook!


+ Developing a feedback survey for our trainers post-workshop (how can we make the experience better, has your perception of homelessness improved since working with us)?

Career Mentor Role:
 
Imagine yourself back in high school trying to figure out what your career path should be. What you read about the career that interests you looks good, but could it REALLY be what you want? What does a person in that position actually do? What is their life like? These and others are the questions that many high school students are asking. Students are confused, excited, and optimistic, and they can’t wait to jump into an amazing job! A chance to hear from a career mentor who has their dream job could help alleviate some of the stress that goes along with making important decisions about the future. 
 
We are looking for Career Mentors to participate in roundtable discussions with high school students and share information about their career, education, and background. Specifically, we would love to engage mentors from the following fields:

Science
Medicine
Tradespeople
Artists/Creative Backgrounds
First Responders/Emergency Services
“Unique” careers (e.g. zookeeper, marine biologist, airplane mechanic, etc.)
Military
**If you don’t see your career listed here but you’d still like to be involved, please kindly let us know!

 
Guidelines and Expectations: 
 
Each mentor will speak to 5-8 students at a time at a single table. The students will be joining us from secondary schools in the area and may have selected their industries of interest before the event. Teacher supervisors will also be a part of the day, but your focus is on our youth. 
 
Over the course of the Career Mentoring sessions, you will speak with several groups of students as you or they rotate around the room.
 
When speaking with students ensure that you remember to discuss the industry that you are representing at this event – e.g. – engineering, legal aid, energy, etc. Have fun with this! Relax, laugh and have a great time! You are mentoring our leaders of tomorrow! 
 
Here is a snapshot of what you could be talking about: 
·         Talk about your education 
o    Where did you go to high school?

o    What certifications did you complete? 
o    What are any other educational and learning experiences you’ve had? 
·         Talk about your career path 
o    How did you get into your field?

Healing Beyond the Body - Cancer Support,"Toronto, Ontario",Health and Mental Health,Princess Margaret Cancer Centre,2018-04-03,https://www.volunteertoronto.ca/networking/apply_now.aspx?view=2&id=220224,"

Healing Beyond the Body - Cancer Support Volunteer for Patients and Families
The Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM) knows that people undergoing treatment for cancer have more concerns than just the physical, and that sometimes they don't have the opportunity to express all their fears, frustrations and needs. Sometimes people try to bottle up their emotions to ""protect"" their families, or they get shut down by others when they try to talk about how they're doing. The Healing Beyond the Body program at the Princess Margaret trains volunteers to meet with patients and their families in waiting rooms and treatment areas throughout the hospital. Volunteers know about the resources available to people with cancer, and also know that everyone needs to cry, vent, or just talk about last night's hockey game. We also help patients and their families to prepare for the appointment with the doctor - so all questions are answered, or we can help patients and caregivers speak to a librarian who will do a literature search just on the specific diagnosis or treatment.

Training:
Training in active listening, cancer treatment, self care, assertiveness skills, infection control, privacy and confidentiality is required before the volunteer work begins and is available every other month. Subsequently you will be paired with existing volunteers to shadow them and work alongside them before beginning to work alone. You will receive ongoing support from program staff. Twice monthly educational sessions on a wide range of topics are scheduled. Monthly educational sessions are held on a variety of topics - from Chemo Questions to Dealing with Loss and Grief to Cancer Related Fatigue and What to Say when You've Said the Wrong Thing.

Skills And Experience Required:
If you are caring, energetic, have strong interpersonal skills, know when to listen and when to talk - or are willing to learn - we'd love to meet with you. We need volunteers who can be available for a minimum of 1 shift per week. Each shift is 3 - 4 hours and between 9am - 5pm. All shifts are during daytime clinic hours, Monday - Friday. We also ask that you expect to be available to contribute for a minimum of one year.
