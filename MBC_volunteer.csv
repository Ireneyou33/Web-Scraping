GoalGet outdoors and earn high school volunteer 'community service' hours! The 'Girls Can Too' program provides young women with hands-on learning experiences in construction and ecology. The program is spearheaded and delivered by 3 female university students, and includes mentorship and training opportunities with females from a variety of professions. Get outdoors and earn high school volunteer 'community service' hours, WHILE YOU LEARN! The TRCA 'Girls Can Too' August 17 - 21 camp, 'Revitalizing Rivers', INVITES YOU to learn the enormous importance of water quality as a key indicator of the health of an ecosystem. As water moves from smaller streams to larger bodies of water through the watershed, contaminants are picked up and carried along the way. The interconnectedness of our water systems means that even the smallest streams can negatively impact our water and wildlife, if not properly cared for. In addition to our building projects, we will spend the week exploring ecosystems, assessing stream health, and, most importantly, taking action to help revitalize the stream that flows through Bolton Camp!
