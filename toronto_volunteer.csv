Online Career Mentoring for Experienced Newcomer Professionals in GTA,"Toronto, Ontario",Settlement and Newcomers,TRIEC (Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council),2020-06-05,https://www.volunteertoronto.ca/networking/apply_now.aspx?view=2&id=605614,"

 
 
Are you located in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and do you enjoy sharing your professional experience and engaging with people from diverse backgrounds? Do you have a desire to motivate and inspire others? Do you like building networks and helping people make connections?
 
Then YOU would make a great mentor!
 
We would love you to join our community of volunteer mentors at the Toronto Region Immigrant Employment Council (TRIEC).
 
TRIEC Mentoring Partnership is career-focused program that matches a job-ready newcomer and a volunteer mentor with a similar professional background. Mentors help their mentees understand how the local job market works and build vital professional networks in GTA. In return, mentors learn leadership and coaching skills, gain knowledge of international business practices, and are able to better communicate with a diverse range of colleagues and clients.
 
Mentorship plays a key part in immigrant professionals’ success, as starting out in a new country with a limited professional network, often results in underemployment (taking a job that they are overqualified or underpaid for). 77% of mentees find a job in their occupation or related field within 6 months of completing their partnership.
 
What we ask:

Commit to 18 hours over 3-months. Meetings can be virtual via phone, video call and etc. during the COVID-19 pandemic
Plan to: collaborate with your mentee to help them identify their goals and draft their action plan; share insights about your occupation, industry and Canadian workplace culture generally; identify and facilitate networking and skill building opportunities for your mentee and guide and motivate your mentee in their job search

 
What you get:
TRIEC mentors can access a range of professional development resources including:

Workshops – build cross-cultural competencies and develop your coaching skills using a solution-focused approach
Webinars – gain action-orientated tools and tips for supporting your mentee in their job search

 If you are a member of HRPA or CPA you can claim professional development credits

Networking events – provide the opportunity to meet new and experienced mentors, and exchange solutions and best practices

 
Mentoring with TRIEC helps you:

Enhance your leadership and coaching skills
Develop competency in cross-cultural communication
Keep up-to-date on the job market and industry trends
Give back to the community and your professional sector or field 

 
What you need:

You reside in the Greater Toronto Area 
At least two years of full-time professional experience in your field in Canada
A respect for cultural diversity and have a desire to deepen your understanding
A commitment to actively support your mentee in their job search
A willingness to listen to your mentee and provide advice and introductions relevant to their experience  
A set of references which you’ll be asked for before starting your partnership

 
What you don’t need:

A huge professional network (mentees benefit from your insight into your profession— it’s not all about making introductions, though they can help) 
Decades of work experience (you are there to be a facilitator and to contextualise the Canadian workplace, not to have all the answers)

Prospective mentors from all industries and occupations are encouraged to apply, however, we are currently experiencing an especially high demand for mentors in Marketing & Sales, Business Development, IT, Healthcare, and Engineering and Architecture.

Toronto Humane Society is looking for volunteers to donate their time and expertise making re-usable gowns to be used at the shelter. With an increased need for PPE to keep staff, volunteers and animals safe, and a surge in market demand, the price per gown has quadrupled (4.75 to be exact!). As an organization that strives to be sustainable financially and environmentally, we would like to source gowns from talented sewers. The gowns you will make will be washed and used by staff and volunteers for years to come.

If you want to try your hand at creating our new fashion statements here are a few websites to guide you:

Gowns can be made from polyester or polyester-cotton fabrics (like used bed sheets). If you do not have access to fabric, contact us and we will supply it for you. All designs must have full length arms, cuffs, and ties at the back to be accepted. 
 
We thank you in advance!

The need quickly grew and word spread of our activities and resources, and we increasingly got organized. Now we are partnered with our local Royal Canadian Legion, at 9 Dawes Rd.

Our community is suffering from a closed food bank (Grace Pascoe), the Salvation Army only serving folks once per month, and the nearest pop up library food bank is in Scarborough South-West (Taylor Memorial) which is in itself a neighbourhood suffering from a closed highly used food bank offering no delivery for those single parents with kids, immuno-compromised folks, etc. 

The ETFC is filling a big gap – to serve hungry neighbours! As of this week, we have proudly served 125 families and 600 individuals every week (with a daily, volunteer run, delivery and pick up system) entirely with in-kind direct donations so far.


Together we will make sure that no one is forgotten, no one’s health is compromised, and no one should feel helpless!

						The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of bricks and mortar stores having an online presence to sell their goods and services.

A recent survey of Toronto’s main street businesses found that over 70% could not pay their May rent. The challenge for these independent small businesses is that they need to be able to adapt their business model to begin selling online now and, just as importantly, need to be able to maintain the ability to sell online in post-crisis world that will involve social distancing requirements.

To address this immediate challenge, the City of Toronto and the Toronto Association of Business Improvement Areas (TABIA) are partnering with Shopify and several other organizations to help Toronto’s independent small businesses access build and launch online stores at no-cost.

Toronto’s small business community is made up of almost 90,000 businesses – many of which may not survive this crisis without support and adapting to online selling. The goal of ShopHERE is to provide up to 5,000 of the smallest and most vulnerable of these businesses access to a quick, easy and no-cost solution for getting set up to start selling online right away.

We are excited to be working with companies like Global Skills Hub, Scotiabank and more that are stepping up to the challenge and championing the initiative of supporting small businesses through this challenging time.
