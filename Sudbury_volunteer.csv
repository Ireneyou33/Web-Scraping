How Can I Help?

Where Can I Drop Them Off?

VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT UPDATE: We recognize that many people are eager to come forward and help others at this time. We thank you for your desire to help. CCS continues to need this support, especially given the people we serve are at an increased risk. We are also asking our clients, staff and volunteers to follow the preventative recommendations from public health officials. At this time, in light of the importance of social distancing, we will not be actively recruiting, conducting face to face interviews or onboarding new volunteers.  If you are interested in any position, we would be happy to arrange a phone/online chat to let you know more about who we are and the opportunities. We continue to reassess daily and prepare for the possibility that we may need to change plans and programs to reflect most current recommendations. We will keep in touch with you to provide updates about how we are able to actively continue the important work of supporting the one in two Canadians who will experience cancer. We are also encouraging Canadians to continue to show their support by visiting cancer.ca to discover a variety of ways to donate and support our critically-needed activities. To speak with us about volunteering, please contact Erin McLean at erin.mclean@ontario.cancer.ca

Description

UPDATE: Meals on Wheels is in desperate need of volunteers to help service their clients with nutritious meals. These individuals may not be able to leave their homes due to COVID-19 (isolated, physical limitations, etc.). If you are interested in helping, please contact them directly. 
 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) is a community-focused organization embracing volunteerism in the provision of nutritious meals and services. All the meals are delivered within the community by dedicated volunteers. Our volunteers enjoy being part of delivering healthy, hot meals to clients and ensuring that everyone is having a great day.
Volunteer Delivery Drivers support both hot and frozen meal programs by delivering meals directly to our client’s homes.
Roles and Responsibilities
 - Meal delivery occurs between 10:30 am and 1:00 pm, Monday-Friday (most routes do not take the full 2.5h to deliver)
 - Volunteers meet at our office (1127 Bancroft Drive) at 10:15 am on the day of their scheduled delivery
 - Volunteers will receive their route list, complete with client name, address and general driving directions.
 - There is a maximum of 18 meals per route, although the average meal count is 14 meals/route.
** As the coordinator, I make every attempt to assign our Volunteers to a route in an area they feel the most comfortable driving, i.e., know the area. I also try to my best to keep the Volunteers on that specific route to becoming familiar with the clients.
 
Qualifications
 - All Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) volunteers will complete an interview to determine their interests and best suitable position.
 - Must possess a valid driver's license and have a reliable, insured vehicle
 - Must pass a screening process which includes a Vulnerable Sector Check 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) policy states that Volunteers must offer their time at least once per month, to remain as a registered volunteer. However, we do understand that vacations and life events may interrupt scheduling. As well our policies insist that all Volunteers receive proper training in meal delivery, Agency processes, and client privacy before going on delivery.
What we do for you
 - Gain valuable work experience
 - Give back to the community
 - Make a positive difference
 - Develop new skills
 - Network and meet new people
 - Enrich your life
Help us help them; volunteer for Meals on Wheels! You are not only delivering a meal; you're providing a smile!

How Can I Help?
The masks created will be used by all approved visitors who enter HSN, all discharged patients as they reintegrate into the community, and the broader community for disease transmission prevention. 
Please click the link above for a list of what you will need, and example patterns.
 
Where Can I Drop Them Off?

VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT UPDATE: We recognize that many people are eager to come forward and help others at this time. We thank you for your desire to help. CCS continues to need this support, especially given the people we serve are at an increased risk. We are also asking our clients, staff and volunteers to follow the preventative recommendations from public health officials. At this time, in light of the importance of social distancing, we will not be actively recruiting, conducting face to face interviews or onboarding new volunteers.  If you are interested in any position, we would be happy to arrange a phone/online chat to let you know more about who we are and the opportunities. We continue to reassess daily and prepare for the possibility that we may need to change plans and programs to reflect most current recommendations. We will keep in touch with you to provide updates about how we are able to actively continue the important work of supporting the one in two Canadians who will experience cancer. We are also encouraging Canadians to continue to show their support by visiting cancer.ca to discover a variety of ways to donate and support our critically-needed activities. To speak with us about volunteering, please contact Erin McLean at erin.mclean@ontario.cancer.ca  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Do you want to have an impact when you volunteer? We want you to as well. Here’s how. As the Logistics Run Director you will manage and empower a committee while driving all logistical elements of the CIBC Run for the Cure.

Your team will develop and execute a site plan, organize a 1km and 5km route, and recruit volunteers to support all local Run activities on the day of the event.

Description

UPDATE: Meals on Wheels is in desperate need of volunteers to help service their clients with nutritious meals. These individuals may not be able to leave their homes due to COVID-19 (isolated, physical limitations, etc.). If you are interested in helping, please contact them directly. 
 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) is a community-focused organization embracing volunteerism in the provision of nutritious meals and services. All the meals are delivered within the community by dedicated volunteers. Our volunteers enjoy being part of delivering healthy, hot meals to clients and ensuring that everyone is having a great day.
Volunteer Delivery Drivers support both hot and frozen meal programs by delivering meals directly to our client’s homes.
Roles and Responsibilities
 - Meal delivery occurs between 10:30 am and 1:00 pm, Monday-Friday (most routes do not take the full 2.5h to deliver)
 - Volunteers meet at our office (1127 Bancroft Drive) at 10:15 am on the day of their scheduled delivery
 - Volunteers will receive their route list, complete with client name, address and general driving directions.
 - There is a maximum of 18 meals per route, although the average meal count is 14 meals/route.
** As the coordinator, I make every attempt to assign our Volunteers to a route in an area they feel the most comfortable driving, i.e., know the area. I also try to my best to keep the Volunteers on that specific route to becoming familiar with the clients.
 
Qualifications
 - All Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) volunteers will complete an interview to determine their interests and best suitable position.
 - Must possess a valid driver's license and have a reliable, insured vehicle
 - Must pass a screening process which includes a Vulnerable Sector Check 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) policy states that Volunteers must offer their time at least once per month, to remain as a registered volunteer. However, we do understand that vacations and life events may interrupt scheduling. As well our policies insist that all Volunteers receive proper training in meal delivery, Agency processes, and client privacy before going on delivery.
What we do for you
 - Gain valuable work experience
 - Give back to the community
 - Make a positive difference
 - Develop new skills
 - Network and meet new people
 - Enrich your life
Help us help them; volunteer for Meals on Wheels! You are not only delivering a meal; you're providing a smile!
 
**Interested volunteers should respond to this ad, or visit out website to complete an application. The Volunteer Coordinator will reach out to you as soon as possible! 
Thank you!

PLEASE NOTE: ALL HANDMADE MASKS MUST BE DROPPED OFF AT SUDBURY STEAM CLEANERS!
 
With the current COVID-19 Pandemic, there is a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, otherwise known as PPE. In order to keep our community healthy and safe, HSN is issuing a challenge to all Northeastern Ontario Sewers to collectively make masks!
 
For those interested in the challenge, please follow this link: https://www.hsnsudbury.ca/portalen/Patients-and-Visitors/COVID-19/Personal-Protective-Equipment-PPE-Supplies/HSN-Mask-Challenge
 
How Can I Help?
The masks created will be used by all approved visitors who enter HSN, all discharged patients as they reintegrate into the community, and the broader community for disease transmission prevention. 
Please click the link above for a list of what you will need, and example patterns.
 
Where Can I Drop Them Off?
The masks MUST be dropped off at the Sudbury Steam Cleaners (210 Walnut Street, Sudbury, Ontario) between 7:30am and 6:00pm Monday to Friday in the covered bin labelled ""Donated Masks Drop Off"" outside the front depot entrance. 
HSN asks that all donations are put in a plastic bag, along with your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Providing contact information is optional, and will be used by the Foundation at Health Science North to say thank you for participating in the HSN Mask Challenge and shre updates on their progress.

Despite COVID-19, we are still working hard to ensure we can continue to provide services to vulnerable / homeless youth in our community (specifically - the downtown core). Visit our website to learn more about our mission, vision and values. www.sacy.ca
 
 
YOUR COMMITMENT:
Our volunteer board, comprised of skilled community professionals, meets monthly (currently over zoom) on the 3rd Thursday of the month between 7:00am-9:00am. The Treasurer works closely with the Executive Director to ensure financial governance and is expected to chair the finance committee which currently has a team of 3 board members.
 
TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
As chair of the finance committee, you can call meetings as often as you like, but it is recommended that the committee meet a minimum of once/month. The finance committee is responsible for preparing cash-flow projections, analyzing balance sheets and preparing KPIs for the board.

To provide high quality services to clients in need, and win community/provincial service contracts, the organization must keep its overhead and administrative fees low. We are looking for a skilled volunteer to help us achieve this goal. Your efforts could have a BIG impact on the health and well-being of our downtown core.

VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT UPDATE: We recognize that many people are eager to come forward and help others at this time. We thank you for your desire to help.

At this time, in light of the importance of social distancing, we will not be actively recruiting, conducting face to face interviews or onboarding new volunteers.  If you are interested in any position, we would be happy to arrange a phone/online chat to let you know more about who we are and the opportunities. We continue to reassess daily and prepare for the possibility that we may need to change plans and programs to reflect most current recommendations. We will keep in touch with you to provide updates about how we are able to actively continue the important work of supporting the one in two Canadians who will experience cancer. We are also encouraging Canadians to continue to show their support by visiting cancer.ca to discover a variety of ways to donate and support our critically-needed activities. To speak with us about volunteering, please contact Erin McLean at erin.mclean@ontario.cancer.ca

 - Volunteers will receive their route list, complete with client name, address and general driving directions.
 - There is a maximum of 18 meals per route, although the average meal count is 14 meals/route.
** As the coordinator, I make every attempt to assign our Volunteers to a route in an area they feel the most comfortable driving, i.e., know the area. I also try to my best to keep the Volunteers on that specific route to becoming familiar with the clients.
 
Qualifications

 - Must possess a valid driver's license and have a reliable, insured vehicle
 - Must pass a screening process which includes a Vulnerable Sector Check 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) policy states that Volunteers must offer their time at least once per month, to remain as a registered volunteer. However, we do understand that vacations and life events may interrupt scheduling. As well our policies insist that all Volunteers receive proper training in meal delivery, Agency processes, and client privacy before going on delivery.

 - Gain valuable work experience
 - Give back to the community
 - Make a positive difference

PLEASE NOTE: ALL HANDMADE MASKS MUST BE DROPPED OFF AT SUDBURY STEAM CLEANERS!
 
With the current COVID-19 Pandemic, there is a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, otherwise known as PPE. In order to keep our community healthy and safe, HSN is issuing a challenge to all Northeastern Ontario Sewers to collectively make masks!
 
For those interested in the challenge, please follow this link: https://www.hsnsudbury.ca/portalen/Patients-and-Visitors/COVID-19/Personal-Protective-Equipment-PPE-Supplies/HSN-Mask-Challenge
 
How Can I Help?
The masks created will be used by all approved visitors who enter HSN, all discharged patients as they reintegrate into the community, and the broader community for disease transmission prevention. 
Please click the link above for a list of what you will need, and example patterns.
 
Where Can I Drop Them Off?
The masks MUST be dropped off at the Sudbury Steam Cleaners (210 Walnut Street, Sudbury, Ontario) between 7:30am and 6:00pm Monday to Friday in the covered bin labelled ""Donated Masks Drop Off"" outside the front depot entrance. 
HSN asks that all donations are put in a plastic bag, along with your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Providing contact information is optional, and will be used by the Foundation at Health Science North to say thank you for participating in the HSN Mask Challenge and shre updates on their progress.

Despite COVID-19, we are still working hard to ensure we can continue to provide services to vulnerable / homeless youth in our community (specifically - the downtown core). Visit our website to learn more about our mission, vision and values. www.sacy.ca
 
 
YOUR COMMITMENT:
Our volunteer board, comprised of skilled community professionals, meets monthly (currently over zoom) on the 3rd Thursday of the month between 7:00am-9:00am.

TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
As chair of the finance committee, you can call meetings as often as you like, but it is recommended that the committee meet a minimum of once/month. The finance committee is responsible for preparing cash-flow projections, analyzing balance sheets and preparing KPIs for the board.

To provide high quality services to clients in need, and win community/provincial service contracts, the organization must keep its overhead and administrative fees low.

VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT UPDATE: We recognize that many people are eager to come forward and help others at this time. We thank you for your desire to help. CCS continues to need this support, especially given the people we serve are at an increased risk. We are also asking our clients, staff and volunteers to follow the preventative recommendations from public health officials. At this time, in light of the importance of social distancing, we will not be actively recruiting, conducting face to face interviews or onboarding new volunteers.  If you are interested in any position, we would be happy to arrange a phone/online chat to let you know more about who we are and the opportunities. We continue to reassess daily and prepare for the possibility that we may need to change plans and programs to reflect most current recommendations. We will keep in touch with you to provide updates about how we are able to actively continue the important work of supporting the one in two Canadians who will experience cancer. We are also encouraging Canadians to continue to show their support by visiting cancer.ca to discover a variety of ways to donate and support our critically-needed activities. To speak with us about volunteering, please contact Erin McLean at erin.mclean@ontario.cancer.ca

Your team will develop and execute a site plan, organize a 1km and 5km route, and recruit volunteers to support all local Run activities on the day of the event.

Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) is a community-focused organization embracing volunteerism in the provision of nutritious meals and services. All the meals are delivered within the community by dedicated volunteers. Our volunteers enjoy being part of delivering healthy, hot meals to clients and ensuring that everyone is having a great day.
Volunteer Delivery Drivers support both hot and frozen meal programs by delivering meals directly to our client’s homes.
Roles and Responsibilities
 - Meal delivery occurs between 10:30 am and 1:00 pm, Monday-Friday (most routes do not take the full 2.5h to deliver)
 - Volunteers meet at our office (1127 Bancroft Drive) at 10:15 am on the day of their scheduled delivery
 - Volunteers will receive their route list, complete with client name, address and general driving directions.
 - There is a maximum of 18 meals per route, although the average meal count is 14 meals/route.
** As the coordinator, I make every attempt to assign our Volunteers to a route in an area they feel the most comfortable driving, i.e., know the area. I also try to my best to keep the Volunteers on that specific route to becoming familiar with the clients.
 
Qualifications
 - All Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) volunteers will complete an interview to determine their interests and best suitable position.
 - Must possess a valid driver's license and have a reliable, insured vehicle
 - Must pass a screening process which includes a Vulnerable Sector Check 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) policy states that Volunteers must offer their time at least once per month, to remain as a registered volunteer. However, we do understand that vacations and life events may interrupt scheduling. As well our policies insist that all Volunteers receive proper training in meal delivery, Agency processes, and client privacy before going on delivery.
What we do for you
 - Gain valuable work experience
 - Give back to the community
 - Make a positive difference
 - Develop new skills
 - Network and meet new people
 - Enrich your life
Help us help them; volunteer for Meals on Wheels! You are not only delivering a meal; you're providing a smile!

How Can I Help?
The masks created will be used by all approved visitors who enter HSN, all discharged patients as they reintegrate into the community, and the broader community for disease transmission prevention. 
Please click the link above for a list of what you will need, and example patterns.
 
Where Can I Drop Them Off?

VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT UPDATE: We recognize that many people are eager to come forward and help others at this time. We thank you for your desire to help. CCS continues to need this support, especially given the people we serve are at an increased risk. We are also asking our clients, staff and volunteers to follow the preventative recommendations from public health officials. At this time, in light of the importance of social distancing, we will not be actively recruiting, conducting face to face interviews or onboarding new volunteers.  If you are interested in any position, we would be happy to arrange a phone/online chat to let you know more about who we are and the opportunities. We continue to reassess daily and prepare for the possibility that we may need to change plans and programs to reflect most current recommendations. We will keep in touch with you to provide updates about how we are able to actively continue the important work of supporting the one in two Canadians who will experience cancer. We are also encouraging Canadians to continue to show their support by visiting cancer.ca to discover a variety of ways to donate and support our critically-needed activities. To speak with us about volunteering, please contact Erin McLean at erin.mclean@ontario.cancer.ca

Description

UPDATE: Meals on Wheels is in desperate need of volunteers to help service their clients with nutritious meals. These individuals may not be able to leave their homes due to COVID-19 (isolated, physical limitations, etc.). If you are interested in helping, please contact them directly. 
 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) is a community-focused organization embracing volunteerism in the provision of nutritious meals and services. All the meals are delivered within the community by dedicated volunteers. Our volunteers enjoy being part of delivering healthy, hot meals to clients and ensuring that everyone is having a great day.
Volunteer Delivery Drivers support both hot and frozen meal programs by delivering meals directly to our client’s homes.
Roles and Responsibilities
 - Meal delivery occurs between 10:30 am and 1:00 pm, Monday-Friday (most routes do not take the full 2.5h to deliver)
 - Volunteers meet at our office (1127 Bancroft Drive) at 10:15 am on the day of their scheduled delivery
 - Volunteers will receive their route list, complete with client name, address and general driving directions.
 - There is a maximum of 18 meals per route, although the average meal count is 14 meals/route.
** As the coordinator, I make every attempt to assign our Volunteers to a route in an area they feel the most comfortable driving, i.e., know the area. I also try to my best to keep the Volunteers on that specific route to becoming familiar with the clients.
 
Qualifications
 - All Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) volunteers will complete an interview to determine their interests and best suitable position.
 - Must possess a valid driver's license and have a reliable, insured vehicle
 - Must pass a screening process which includes a Vulnerable Sector Check 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) policy states that Volunteers must offer their time at least once per month, to remain as a registered volunteer. However, we do understand that vacations and life events may interrupt scheduling. As well our policies insist that all Volunteers receive proper training in meal delivery, Agency processes, and client privacy before going on delivery.
What we do for you
 - Gain valuable work experience
 - Give back to the community
 - Make a positive difference
 - Develop new skills
 - Network and meet new people
 - Enrich your life
Help us help them; volunteer for Meals on Wheels! You are not only delivering a meal; you're providing a smile!

How Can I Help?
The masks created will be used by all approved visitors who enter HSN, all discharged patients as they reintegrate into the community, and the broader community for disease transmission prevention. 
Please click the link above for a list of what you will need, and example patterns.
 
Where Can I Drop Them Off?

VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT UPDATE: We recognize that many people are eager to come forward and help others at this time. We thank you for your desire to help. CCS continues to need this support, especially given the people we serve are at an increased risk. We are also asking our clients, staff and volunteers to follow the preventative recommendations from public health officials. At this time, in light of the importance of social distancing, we will not be actively recruiting, conducting face to face interviews or onboarding new volunteers.  If you are interested in any position, we would be happy to arrange a phone/online chat to let you know more about who we are and the opportunities. We continue to reassess daily and prepare for the possibility that we may need to change plans and programs to reflect most current recommendations. We will keep in touch with you to provide updates about how we are able to actively continue the important work of supporting the one in two Canadians who will experience cancer. We are also encouraging Canadians to continue to show their support by visiting cancer.ca to discover a variety of ways to donate and support our critically-needed activities. To speak with us about volunteering, please contact Erin McLean at erin.mclean@ontario.cancer.ca  
_____________________________________________________________________________________________
Do you want to have an impact when you volunteer? We want you to as well. Here’s how. As the Logistics Run Director you will manage and empower a committee while driving all logistical elements of the CIBC Run for the Cure.

Your team will develop and execute a site plan, organize a 1km and 5km route, and recruit volunteers to support all local Run activities on the day of the event.

Description

UPDATE: Meals on Wheels is in desperate need of volunteers to help service their clients with nutritious meals. These individuals may not be able to leave their homes due to COVID-19 (isolated, physical limitations, etc.). If you are interested in helping, please contact them directly. 
 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) is a community-focused organization embracing volunteerism in the provision of nutritious meals and services. All the meals are delivered within the community by dedicated volunteers. Our volunteers enjoy being part of delivering healthy, hot meals to clients and ensuring that everyone is having a great day.
Volunteer Delivery Drivers support both hot and frozen meal programs by delivering meals directly to our client’s homes.
Roles and Responsibilities
 - Meal delivery occurs between 10:30 am and 1:00 pm, Monday-Friday (most routes do not take the full 2.5h to deliver)
 - Volunteers meet at our office (1127 Bancroft Drive) at 10:15 am on the day of their scheduled delivery
 - Volunteers will receive their route list, complete with client name, address and general driving directions.
 - There is a maximum of 18 meals per route, although the average meal count is 14 meals/route.
** As the coordinator, I make every attempt to assign our Volunteers to a route in an area they feel the most comfortable driving, i.e., know the area. I also try to my best to keep the Volunteers on that specific route to becoming familiar with the clients.
 
Qualifications
 - All Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) volunteers will complete an interview to determine their interests and best suitable position.
 - Must possess a valid driver's license and have a reliable, insured vehicle
 - Must pass a screening process which includes a Vulnerable Sector Check 
Meals On Wheels (Sudbury) policy states that Volunteers must offer their time at least once per month, to remain as a registered volunteer. However, we do understand that vacations and life events may interrupt scheduling. As well our policies insist that all Volunteers receive proper training in meal delivery, Agency processes, and client privacy before going on delivery.
What we do for you
 - Gain valuable work experience
 - Give back to the community
 - Make a positive difference
 - Develop new skills
 - Network and meet new people
 - Enrich your life
Help us help them; volunteer for Meals on Wheels! You are not only delivering a meal; you're providing a smile!
 
**Interested volunteers should respond to this ad, or visit out website to complete an application. The Volunteer Coordinator will reach out to you as soon as possible! 
Thank you!

PLEASE NOTE: ALL HANDMADE MASKS MUST BE DROPPED OFF AT SUDBURY STEAM CLEANERS!
 
With the current COVID-19 Pandemic, there is a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, otherwise known as PPE. In order to keep our community healthy and safe, HSN is issuing a challenge to all Northeastern Ontario Sewers to collectively make masks!
 
For those interested in the challenge, please follow this link: https://www.hsnsudbury.ca/portalen/Patients-and-Visitors/COVID-19/Personal-Protective-Equipment-PPE-Supplies/HSN-Mask-Challenge
 
How Can I Help?
The masks created will be used by all approved visitors who enter HSN, all discharged patients as they reintegrate into the community, and the broader community for disease transmission prevention. 
Please click the link above for a list of what you will need, and example patterns.
 
Where Can I Drop Them Off?
The masks MUST be dropped off at the Sudbury Steam Cleaners (210 Walnut Street, Sudbury, Ontario) between 7:30am and 6:00pm Monday to Friday in the covered bin labelled ""Donated Masks Drop Off"" outside the front depot entrance. 
HSN asks that all donations are put in a plastic bag, along with your name, mailing address, email address, and phone number. Providing contact information is optional, and will be used by the Foundation at Health Science North to say thank you for participating in the HSN Mask Challenge and shre updates on their progress.

Despite COVID-19, we are still working hard to ensure we can continue to provide services to vulnerable / homeless youth in our community (specifically - the downtown core). Visit our website to learn more about our mission, vision and values. www.sacy.ca
 
 
YOUR COMMITMENT:
Our volunteer board, comprised of skilled community professionals, meets monthly (currently over zoom) on the 3rd Thursday of the month between 7:00am-9:00am. The Treasurer works closely with the Executive Director to ensure financial governance and is expected to chair the finance committee which currently has a team of 3 board members.
 
TASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
As chair of the finance committee, you can call meetings as often as you like, but it is recommended that the committee meet a minimum of once/month. The finance committee is responsible for preparing cash-flow projections, analyzing balance sheets and preparing KPIs for the board.

THE IMPACT:
To provide high quality services to clients in need, and win community/provincial service contracts, the organization must keep its overhead and administrative fees low. We are looking for a skilled volunteer to help us achieve this goal. Your efforts could have a BIG impact on the health and well-being of our downtown core.

VOLUNTEER RECRUITMENT UPDATE: We recognize that many people are eager to come forward and help others at this time. We thank you for your desire to help. CCS continues to need this support, especially given the people we serve are at an increased risk. We are also asking our clients, staff and volunteers to follow the preventative recommendations from public health officials. At this time, in light of the importance of social distancing, we will not be actively recruiting, conducting face to face interviews or onboarding new volunteers.  If you are interested in any position, we would be happy to arrange a phone/online chat to let you know more about who we are and the opportunities. We continue to reassess daily and prepare for the possibility that we may need to change plans and programs to reflect most current recommendations. We will keep in touch with you to provide updates about how we are able to actively continue the important work of supporting the one in two Canadians who will experience cancer. We are also encouraging Canadians to continue to show their support by visiting cancer.ca to discover a variety of ways to donate and support our critically-needed activities. To speak with us about volunteering, please contact Erin McLean at erin.mclean@ontario.cancer.ca
